# Hi! I'm Diana 🪷🐠🐈


Hi there, I'm Diana Barills, and I'm a recent graduate of California State University, Los Angeles, where I earned my B.A. in Economics and Computer Science. With a strong interest in software engineering and product management, I'm eager to make my mark as a budding professional. My diverse skill set includes expertise in back-end web development, software testing, artificial intelligence, and animation.

What really captures my imagination is the potential of AI/ML to revolutionize consumer entertainment, especially in the realm of music and video streaming. When I'm not working, I love indulging my creative side by creating art, taking photographs, framing insects, sewing, and playing a range of sports, from tennis to aerobics
